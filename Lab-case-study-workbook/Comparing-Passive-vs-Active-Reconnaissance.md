## Comparing Passive vs Active Reconnaissance

| **Aspect** | **Passive Reconnaissance** | **Active Reconnaissance** |
|-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Tool Examples** | `whois`, `theHarvester`, `nslookup` | `nmap`, `ping`, `netdiscover`, `traceroute` |
| **Risk Level** | Low | High |
| **Detection Possibility** | Minimal | High |

### Summary

Passive reconnaissance gathers information without directly engaging the target, using publicly available sources such as domain records, DNS data, and search engines. Itâ€™s ideal for early information gathering when stealth is important.  

Active reconnaissance directly interacts with the target using tools like `nmap`, `ping`, and `netdiscover` to discover open ports, live hosts, and services. It provides more detailed insights but has a higher risk of detection and should only be done with authorization.
