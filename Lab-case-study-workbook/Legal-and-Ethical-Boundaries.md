# Cyberattack Case Study Report

## 1. Dropbox Phishing Attack — November 1, 2022
**Type:** Unauthorized (Illegal)  
**Justification:**  
The phishing campaign that tricked Dropbox employees into revealing their GitHub credentials was **not authorized by the company**. Attackers created a fake CircleCI login page to steal access tokens and repositories, violating privacy and cybersecurity laws. This was an illegal cyberattack motivated by data theft rather than security testing.

## 2. Optus Data Breach — September 22, 2022
**Type:** Unauthorized (Illegal)  
**Justification:**  
The Optus breach involved an attacker exploiting an exposed API to access customer records. There was **no permission or legal authorization** for this intrusion, and it resulted in the exposure of over 10 million users’ data. Such actions breach both data protection laws and ethical hacking boundaries.

## 3. The Telegraph Data Leak — October 5, 2021
**Type:** Ethical (Authorized/Accidental)  
**Justification:**  
Although The Telegraph’s servers were left unsecured, the **leak itself wasn’t caused by a hacker’s deliberate intrusion** but by internal misconfiguration. When security researchers later discovered and reported it, that act was ethical since it helped identify a vulnerability responsibly without exploiting it for harm.
